# In-Class 1 - Creating Hello World & Static Pages

## Author



## Description

In this In-Class we will be setting up a Django project from scratch.
Ensuring that all of our tooling is set up correctly and ready for a much
larger project. In addition, we will cover the very basics to have the framework
first serve a single static page that says Hello World. Then once we know that
is working, we will update it to serve multiple static pages.
